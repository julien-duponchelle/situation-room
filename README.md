# Situation Room

Situation Room allows you to display multiple web pages on a single monitor.  It is intended to create ersatz tactical overviews for display; for example, a combination of [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) and [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) views that can provide a rapid, real-time overview of your ecosystem.
