# Situation Room

Situation Room allows you to display multiple web resources on a single monitor.

Possible use cases:

* Create ersatz tactical overviews for display; for example, a combination of [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) and [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org/) views that can provide a rapid, real-time overview of your ecosystem.
* Display advertisements or other information across multiple monitors in a retail setting.
